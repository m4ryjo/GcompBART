Description: Performs g-computation using Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, 
              as described in Josefsson et al. XXX, with optional sparsity-inducing 
              priors for longitudinal data. This package builds on and extends the 
              SoftBart package by Antonio Linero, reusing and adapting components 
              of its original C++ implementation while maintaining its style for 
              usability.
